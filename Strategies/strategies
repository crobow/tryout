-----------Analysis of Chart using Monte Carlo Markov Chain---------

    - calculate best fitting line for "graph"
    - Split Graph using MCMC, calculate best fitting line for parts
    - Repeat until ceartain precission is reached
    - From that the steepness of Graph at every point is reached. 
    - Integrate to get function.
    
    - Prediction based on function value in the future.
    - gives Hint if Analytical prediction is possible
    
----------Statistical Analysis with Kalman Filter-----------
    
    - For every value calculate probability that next value is positive or negative
    - Predict that probability for the next value
    - Use Kalman Filter for better prediction
    
    -Statistical prediction model
